initial premise: for the game to generate a frame, we need inputs from both players

    [demo showing how each state is a function of the previous state and the new inputs]

problem 1:  the remote player's inputs take time to arrive

solution 1: wait for the remote input before creating a frame (naive solution)

    [demo showing how this works, but fails (increases frame times) as latency increases]

problem 2:  every frame is now delayed by the amount of time it takes for the remote input to arrive

solution 2: delay local inputs (build a buffer)

    [demo showing how a buffer allows for smooth gameplay at high latency, but also how this results in unstable input latency]

problem 3:  sucks for learning precise input timings (delay is based on inconsistent latency)

solution 3: "rollback" netcode

    [rollback demo, potentially in multiple parts to decrease complexity dump]
